WPF-Math was originally ported from the [JMathTex project][jmathtex], copyright 2004-2007 Universiteit Gent. JMathTex is licensed under the terms of GPLv2, and WPF-Math is licensed under the terms of MIT.

Some of the resources included in WPF-Math (`DefaultTexFont.xml`, `GlueSettings.xml`, `PredefinedTexFormulas.xml`, `TexFormulaSettings.xml`, `TexSymbols.xml`) were directly taken from the JMathTex project. To redistribute these resources under the terms of MIT license, we've asked the original authors of JMathTex. Here's a fragment of our email to the JMathTex authors (some irrelevant details from the emails are omitted because they were discussing additional technical topic â€“ about how the resources were initially generated):

> One issue is that our project is licensed under the permissive MIT license, but we're using direct copies of some XML resources from JMathTeX (licensed under the GPL). So, we cannot redistribute these resources under the MIT license (and aren't distributing them currently). Namely these resources are: DefaultTexFont.xml, GlueSettings.xml, PredefinedTexFormulas.xml, TexFormulaSettings.xml, and TexSymbols.xml.

And Dr. Coolsaet kindly granted us a permission:
